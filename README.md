Purposes and guidelines: 
We want to create a platform to help people organize [+ own + govern] our societal progress cooperatives. Originally I thought to limit it just to the social enterprise alliance organizing team, but I think to broaden it a little to all social progress mission efforts, to kind of serve to further unify all our collective efforts under our most commonly desired societal progress goals. I adapted this to be focused locally in Virginia but also want this have the ultimate goal of being an example and productive model of a social progress ecosystem that others can learn from around the world. So our goal is broad enough to inspire scalable social progress work and specific enough to be pragmatic. This group is specifically focused on Virginia social progress, but aspiring to also be a model of a successful productive social progress ecosystems.

Goals, Purposes:
Unify all social progress agents and collectives in Virginia.
Be a model of a productive social progress ecosystem and community for the world to follow.
Facilitate productive organized collaboration processes.
Nurture the spirits, minds, lives of societal proponents.
Produce measurable progress as measured by social progress indicators.
Generate more consensus and synergy among societal progress agents.
